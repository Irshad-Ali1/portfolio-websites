            <p>A Front-End Developer is someone who creates websites and web applications.

                The difference between Front-End and Back-End is that Front-End refers to how a web page looks, while back-end refers to how it works.
                
                You can think of Front-End as client-side and Back-End as server-side.
                
                The basic languages for Front-End Development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
